    # it's strictly recommended to disable password auth for accounts supposed for automated login (better for all!)
    # there are many pitfalls with legacy password schemas -- i.e. you can't be sure 
    #   that some old pam_unix won't silently take only first 8 characters off your password 
    #   also you can't be sure that system can't be tricked into setting up account password known to the attacker
    #       so let's rely on strong crypto (ed25519 keys)
